# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science and Statistics
- I am taking STATS 220 because I'm interested in progressing my skills and it is also a pre-requisite for a stage three course I want to take.
- I am interested in learning about applying skills in data analytics to the real world to solve problems.
