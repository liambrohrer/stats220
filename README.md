## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

### A little about me:

- I am undertaking a **Bachelor of Science** degree
    - I'm majoring in *Computer Science* and *Statistics*
- I am taking STATS 220 for the following reasons:
    1. I'm interested in progressing my skills
    2. It is also a pre-requisite for a stage three course I want to take
- I am interested in learning about applying skills in data analytics to the real world to solve problems.
